	abstract = {ABSTRACT Institutional repositories typically have a submission agreement that is meant to protect the institution hosting the repository and inform submitters of their rights and responsibilities. This article examines how various libraries have created submission agreements, enquires as to issues surrounding them, and identifies commonalities and unique statements. The authors deployed a survey to institutional repository administrators listed in OpenDOAR in the United States. Approximately 7\% of the 304 potential institutional repository managers responded. Library administrators, institutional repositories managers/architects, and legal counsel were the most likely to have input into the creation of the submission agreement; scholarly communications librarians were involved only 20\% of the time. Although submission agreements averaged 282 words arranged in 9 sentences, their reading complexity requires a university degree. Commonalities include characterizing the agreement as a non-exclusive license, indicating the submitter's responsibility for obtaining permissions for any content that they did not produce, and confirming the right of the submitter to enter into the agreement. Submission agreements are generally complex and do not accommodate the common practice of mediated submission. Sharing submission agreements publicly may lead to simplified and standardized language and reduce barriers to submitters.},
